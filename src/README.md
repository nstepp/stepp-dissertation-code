## lsm

Random reservoir implementation, as typically used in reservoir computing. The 'lsm' comes from Liquid State Machine,
but the implementation ended up being an Echo State Network instead.

## pointertrack

Psychophysics toolbox implemetation of a pointer-based game, not unlike the arcade game Galaga. This was used to probe
manual control delay in an environment with multiple delayed stimuli.

## steersim

A very simple driving simulator, used to probe control delay in an environment where information about future states
is available. The original code included hooks into an EyeLink II eye tracking system, but that code is not distributable.
