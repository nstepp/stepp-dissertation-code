\begin{itemize}
\item You will see a moving \textbf{blue square}, the target, on top of the screen in front of you.\\
\item Using the pen and tablet, you control a smaller \textbf{green square}, your ship.\\
\item Bullets are continuously fired from your ship.\\
\item Try to keep up with the target, hitting it as much as possible for \textbf{80 seconds}.\\
\item Trials are repeated for about 30 minutes.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\subsection*{Things to remember}
\begin{itemize}
\item When your bullets are slow, hitting the target is hard, but keep trying!
\item You can take a break after any trial.
\item You're essentially playing a video game, have fun.
\end{itemize}
